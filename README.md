Rock Paper Scissors Game (with Smart AI using DSA)
This is an intelligent Rock Paper Scissors game built using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. Unlike traditional implementations where the AI picks moves randomly, this version uses Data Structures and Algorithms (DSA) to predict the player's move and choose the best counter move accordingly.
